- **Test Suite**: Created comprehensive test suite for provider adapters (13 tests passing)

### Changed
- **Manual Updates Only**: Disabled automatic downloads for all platforms to prevent installation errors
  - App still checks for updates automatically (startup + every 4 hours)
  - Users directed to GitHub Releases for manual downloads
  - Clear warning message with direct link when updates are available
- **Enhanced Logging**: Improved provider validation logging with structured warnings

  - Made stopBackendSync actually wait for timeout before SIGKILL
  - Increased backend shutdown delay from 0.5s to 2.0s for reliable cleanup
  - Added port check retry with exponential backoff (500ms → 1s → 2s, max 6 attempts)
- **External API Integration**: Fixed issues with Google Gemini and Perplexity returning meta-responses
- **Provider Parameter Mapping**: Corrected temperature and parameter translation for all 7 providers

## [0.2.5] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
- Fixed architecture mismatch issue causing "error -86" spawn failures on Intel Macs
- Extended backend initialization timeout to 70 seconds (10 attempts × 1s + 20 attempts × 3s) across all platforms to prevent false-positive timeout errors
- Unified HTTP health check timeout to 3000ms for consistency
- Updated minimum macOS version to 11.0 in build configuration

### Changed
- **macOS Native Builds**: Now building separate native binaries for both architectures:
  - **x64 (Intel)**: Built on `macos-15-intel` runner - native performance on Intel Macs
  - **arm64 (Apple Silicon)**: Built on `macos-14` runner - native performance on M1/M2/M3/M4 Macs
- **Technical Implementation**: Uses GitHub Actions matrix strategy with architecture-specific runners
  - Each architecture builds natively (no cross-compilation)
  - PyInstaller produces optimized binaries for host architecture
  - Separate DMG/ZIP files for each architecture
- **Distribution**: Users download the appropriate installer for their Mac's architecture
- Added `minimumSystemVersion: 11.0` for macOS compatibility documentation

### Technical Note
Due to GitHub Actions retiring Intel Mac runners (macos-12, macos-13), we've switched to building only for Apple Silicon.
Intel Mac users will automatically run the app through Rosetta 2, which provides excellent compatibility and performance.
This is the standard approach for macOS apps as the industry transitions to Apple Silicon.
