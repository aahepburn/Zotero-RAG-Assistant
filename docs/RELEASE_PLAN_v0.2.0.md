2. **Parallel builds** on 3 runners:
   - `ubuntu-24.04` → Linux packages
   - `macos-latest` → macOS installers
   - `windows-latest` → Windows installers

3. **Build artifacts created:**
   - **macOS**:

     - `ZoteroRAG-0.2.0-linux-arm64.AppImage` (ARM)
     - `latest-linux.yml` (auto-update metadata)

4. **Automatic GitHub Release**:
   - Creates release `v0.2.0`
   - Uploads all build artifacts
   - Generates release notes from commits

### Manual Build (If Needed)

If you need to build manually on specific hardware:

#### macOS

```bash
# 1. Create Python bundle (PyInstaller)
./scripts/bundle-python-pyinstaller.sh

# 2. Build Electron app
npm run build
npm run package:mac

# Output: release/*.dmg, release/*.zip, release/latest-mac.yml
```

#### Windows

```powershell
# 1. Create Python bundle (PyInstaller)
.\scripts\bundle-python-pyinstaller-windows.bat

# 2. Build Electron app
npm run build
npm run package:win

# Output: release/*.exe, release/*.zip, release/latest.yml
```

#### Linux

```bash
# 1. Python will be installed on first run (no bundle needed)
# 2. Build Electron app
npm run build
npm run package:linux

# Output: release/*.AppImage, release/*.deb, release/latest-linux.yml
```

## Release Steps

### 1. Prepare Release Branch (Optional)

```bash
git checkout -b release/v0.2.0
# Make any last-minute changes
git commit -am "Final prep for v0.2.0"
git push origin release/v0.2.0
```

### 2. Update Version & Tag

```bash
# Ensure you're on master/main
git checkout master

# Update version in package.json (if not done)
# Edit: "version": "0.2.0"

# Commit version bump
git commit -am "Release v0.2.0"

# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0 - Profile-specific vector databases and Windows support"

# Push commits and tags (triggers CI/CD)
git push origin master
git push origin v0.2.0
```

### 3. Monitor GitHub Actions Build

1. Go to: `https://github.com/aahepburn/Zotero-RAG-Assistant/actions`
2. Watch "Build All Platforms" workflow
3. Verify all 3 jobs complete successfully:
   - ✅ `build-all (ubuntu-24.04)`
   - ✅ `build-all (macos-latest)`
   - ✅ `build-all (windows-latest)`
   - ✅ `create-release`

**Build time:** ~15-25 minutes total

### 4. Verify GitHub Release

1. Go to: `https://github.com/aahepburn/Zotero-RAG-Assistant/releases`
2. Verify `v0.2.0` release exists
3. Check all artifacts are uploaded:
   - [ ] 4 macOS files (2 DMG, 2 ZIP)
   - [ ] 4 Windows files (2 EXE, 2 ZIP)
   - [ ] 3 Linux files (2 AppImage, 1 DEB)
   - [ ] 3 YAML files (latest-mac.yml, latest.yml, latest-linux.yml)

### 5. Edit Release Notes

GitHub auto-generates release notes, but enhance them:

```markdown

## 🔄 Upgrading from 0.1.x

The app will auto-update if you have v0.1.8+. Otherwise, download and install the new version.

**Data Migration:** Your existing profiles and vector databases will be preserved. The old `user-1` path will need to be migrated manually if you want to keep that data - see migration guide in docs.
